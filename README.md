# Welcome to my web portfolio
This portfolio is a platform to display my history, projects, and journals I have over the course of my life.
This is the 2nd version of my portfolio. First version [here](); version 1 is more of a exploratative project and designed without any planning. For this portoflio, I've used online software called *figma*.
